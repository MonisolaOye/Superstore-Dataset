##  PROJECT OVERVIEW

In this project, I utilized Excel, SQL, and Power BI in the analysis of the Super store dataset from Kaggle. 
The Super store is located in the United State where  the stationeries are being sold. This Superstore data is hosted on Google BigQuery for the analysis. 
The purpose of this analysis is to understand and answer some business questions regarding the performance of the Superstore, gain insights, and provide some recommendations to increase revenue.
At the time of analysis, the Superstore recorded sales transaction data from 2014 â€“ 2017. The entire data can be accessed here [superstore dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishanshrivastava28/superstore-sales)

### Data Cleaning Process

The first step I took in the data analysis process was to import the Superstore dataset into Excel for data cleaning to check for errors and inconsistencies. The Superstore dataset comprises of information such as; Sales, Customer Name, Order date, Delivery date, Product category, Ship mode, Country, Region, Product Subcategory, Product Segment, Postal code.

I followed the following steps for the Data cleaning process;

- Data Importation: To kick start with this analysis, I firstly imported the dataset from the File ribbon into the excel spreadsheet.

- Data Cleaning:  To check the dataset for duplicates, I highlighted the whole columns from A to V, then clicked on the Data ribbon on remove duplicates but no duplicates was found.

Then I proceeded to filter each column to check for blanks, errors, misspellings or any outliers for further data cleaning. 

I discovered inconsistencies in the Order Date and Ship Date columns, I proceeded by coverting the Date value to Date with the Text to column tool in the Data ribbon as follows;


  Old Order date column     				                    |     					New Order Date column
:-------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------:

- Data Transformation: In order to calculate the Delivery day, a new column was inserted and the DATEDIF function was used to find the difference between the Ship date and Order date.


 Formula                      				                  |     				Result
:-------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------:

## RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the insightful analysis of the Superstore sales data, I would like to give the following recommendations: 

1. The Superstore should invest more in stocking Phones, Chairs, Storage, Tables and Binders to increase sales and they should be made readily aailable at all times.
2. The South region has the lowest sales figure, marketing strategies and awareness campaign should be implemented in this region to boost sales.
3. Special attention must be paid to the swift and efficient delivery to the Standard class since it is most preffered by the customers and thereby drove in most sales.

## DASHBOARD

A dashboard refers to a visual representation of data that provides a summary and analysis of key information. It consist of charts, graphs, tables and other visual elements that allow users to understand complex data sets. Power BI was used to design the dashboard.

Dashboards allow companies to monitor key performance indicators(KPIs) and track progress towards goals. By providing a real-time or near real-time data, dashboards provide a snapshot of performance and enable teams to identify areas of success that needs attention.

## CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, this comes to the end of my analysis of the Superstore sales data which demonstrate the power of data analysis in making data-driven business decisions. By transforming and analyzing the sales data, I have been able to provide insights and actionable recommendations which can guide the Superstore in enhancing their sales performance.
