##  Introduction
The purpose of this analysis is to understand and answer some business questions regarding the performance of Superstore, gain insights, find trends and provide some recommendations based on the analysis.
In this project, I utilized Excel, SQL, and Power BI in the analysis of the Super store dataset from Kaggle. The Super store is located in the United State and they sell stationeries. This Superstore data is hosted on Google Big Query for the analysis. 
At the time of analysis, the Superstore recorded sales transaction data from 2014 â€“ 2017. The entire data can be accessed here [superstore dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishanshrivastava28/superstore-sales)
